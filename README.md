## Description of Work:
This website caters to scientists and researchers by offering a tool to analyze scientific papers. You can upload your paper in PNG format. The website then utilizes Tesseract OCR, an optical character recognition engine, to extract text from the image.

Once the text is extracted, the system analyzes it using Gemini 1.0 Pro API, a powerful large language model. This analysis retrieves key information like the title and authors' names from the paper. Additionally, the website generates an alternative title for the paper using its own algorithms.

Finally, you have the flexibility to view the extracted information directly on the website or download it as an Excel sheet for further manipulation and analysis. This allows you to easily access the key details of your research paper and potentially discover a new, interesting title for it.
